      "content": "Web developer for 5 years. Working with cutting-edge front-end related technology, I worked for 2 years for [Dernier Cri](https://derniercri.io), been in freelance accompanied by [Studio WAWWW](https://wawww.studio) for bigger dreams, and now teaming up with [Unlikely](https://unlikely.technology) to find another agency cohesion. I love what I do and do it the right way. The stack I use differs depending on the project and needs, but I keep learning new things to build an internet as it should be. With a deep understanding of modern web technologies and frameworks, I strive to create responsive, accessible, and performant web applications. My expertise includes proficiency in JavaScript frameworks, as well as a strong command of HTML, CSS, and related tools and libraries. I prioritize writing clean, maintainable code and adhere to industry best practices. I stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in web development, ensuring that my work is not only visually appealing but also optimized for performance and accessibility"
